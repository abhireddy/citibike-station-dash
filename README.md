# Mapping Citi Bike Availability

An interactive map indicating how often Citi Bike stations had at least one bike or open dock available during periods of peak usage in September 2018. This availability metric can be used to evaluate how well bikes are rebalanced across the network to avoid unnecessary detours for riders.
This visualization was built in [Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash) with mapping provided by Mapbox. You can read my [Medium post](https://medium.com/@abhireddy/mapping-citi-bike-availability-during-rush-hour-b4d7cb9d1069) for more information about this project.
